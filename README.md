# Robust-control-of-the-lateral-dynamics-of-a-multirotor-UAV
This MATLAB project designs and verifies a robust single-axis attitude control system for the ANT-X quadrotor. It includes grey-box modeling from flight tests, dynamic inversion with PID/P controllers, robustness analysis with ±3σ uncertainty, Monte Carlo validation, and performance/control effort verification.
